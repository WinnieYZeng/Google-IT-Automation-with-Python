## Description

## Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)
Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) help different pieces of software talk to each other. When you write a program, you typically use a bunch of existing libraries for the programming language of your choice. These libraries provide APIs in the form of external or public functions, classes, and methods that other code can use to get their job done without having to create a lot of repeated code. 
### The project 'Scale and convert images using PIL'
In this project, you will write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:
Iterate through each file in the folder
For each file:
- Rotate the image 90 clockwise
- Resize the image from 192 x 192 to 128 x 128
- Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format
